    "Ans To select the most pertinent attributes for a customer churn predictive model using the Filter Method, I would follow these steps:\n",

    "1. Understand the Dataset and Target Variable\n",
    "First, I would gain a clear understanding of the dataset and its features, along with the target variable, which in this case is customer churn (often represented as a binary outcome: churn or no churn).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Preprocess the Data\n",
    "Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.\n",

    "The Filter Method relies on statistical measures to evaluate the relevance of each feature. Depending on the type of feature (continuous or categorical) and the target variable, different metrics can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation Coefficients (for continuous features):\n",
    "I would calculate the correlation between each feature and the target variable (e.g., Pearson’s correlation). Features with higher correlation (positive or negative) are more relevant to the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chi-square Test (for categorical features):\n",
    "This test measures the dependence between each categorical feature and the target variable. A higher chi-square value indicates greater dependence, meaning the feature is more relevant.\n",

    "After applying the chosen metric, rank the features in order of their relevance to the target variable. The higher-ranked features are likely to contribute more to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Select the Top-N Features\n",

    "After selecting the features, I would build a preliminary model using them and evaluate its performance (e.g., using cross-validation). If necessary, I might iterate by adjusting the number of features or trying other techniques like the Wrapper or Embedded Methods to further refine feature selection.\n",
